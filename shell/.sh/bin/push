# `push`
#
# Wrap `git push` for convenience. `push` makes it easy to push the current
# branch to a remote, so it's less likely that a branch will be pushed to the
# wrong place (for example, pushing `feature/add-widget` to `master`).
#
# @example Push the current branch to the 'origin' remote
#   push to origin
# @example Push a different branch to the 'upstream' remote
#   push feature/add-widget to upstream
###

  branch="$(git current-ref)"
  remote="$2"
# `push feature/add-widget to upstream`
